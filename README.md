## Inspiration

A lot of inspiration came [Moustachauve](https://github.com/Moustachauve)'s [WLED-Native-iOS](https://github.com/Moustachauve/WLED-Native-iOS). 
I wanted to see if I could build a WLED app using SwiftUI and the new SwiftData framework. I also wanted to create a prettier app for on iPads and possibly an Apple Watch app.
